#README: Analyzing Cyclist Behavior and Conversion

Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes the behavior of two cyclist categories: annual members and casual riders. The goal is to understand the differences between these groups and identify strategies to convert casual riders into annual subscribers.

##Data Exploration and Preprocessing
**Data Source**: A dataset containing information about cyclist rides, including starting/ending stations, timestamps, and member type.
**Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
**Data Transformation**: Calculated ride duration using Pandas, extracted ride start/end times, and determined the day of the week.

##Power BI Dashboard Development
Dashboard Design: A visually appealing and interactive dashboard with clear visualizations.
###Key Visualizations:
*Ride Duration Analysis: Comparing average ride durations for annual members and casual riders.
*Ride Frequency Analysis: Examining the frequency of rides for each category.
*Day-of-Week Analysis: Comparing ride patterns across different days of the week.

###Key Metrics:
*Total rides for each category
*Average ride duration
*Peak usage times

##Recommendations
**Targeted Marketing**: Offer promotions or discounts to casual riders during off-peak hours or weekdays to encourage more frequent usage.
**Membership Benefits:** Enhance membership benefits to provide additional value to annual subscribers, such as exclusive access to events or discounts on merchandise.
**Flexible Membership Options:** Consider introducing flexible membership plans to cater to the needs of casual riders who may not require a full-year commitment.

##Usage Instructions
*Prerequisites: Power BI Desktop
*Steps to Use: Open the .pbix file, connect to the data source (if necessary), and refresh the data.
